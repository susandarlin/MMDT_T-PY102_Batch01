Lab01.py — Linked List Lab (Auto-graded)

Covers:
- LeetCode 206: Reverse Linked List
- LeetCode 2816: Double a Number Represented as a Linked List

Lab format:
- Node classes are defined separately from LinkedList wrappers.

Student instructions:
- Do NOT change required function names/signatures.
- You MAY add helper functions/methods.
- Use pointer manipulation (don’t solve by converting the whole list to an int or Python list).

    LeetCode 2816 — Double a Number Represented as a Linked List

    Digits are stored in forward order (most significant digit first).
    Return the head of a new list (or reuse nodes) representing 2x the number.

    Examples:
      1 -> 8 -> 9   (189)  =>  3 -> 7 -> 8  (378)
      9 -> 9 -> 9   (999)  =>  1 -> 9 -> 9 -> 8  (1998)

    Requirements:
    - Use linked-list operations/pointer logic.
    - Avoid converting the entire list into an integer/string for the core solution.
